# NITC on Blocks 

**NITC on Blocks** is a custom blockchain implementation developed as part of an academic project at NIT Calicut. This project is designed to explore the inner workings of blockchain technology through a step-by-step, language-agnostic approach.

##  Overview

The project is divided into six well-structured stages to ensure clarity and depth in understanding. The final output is a fully functioning blockchain prototype with:

- A **native cryptocurrency**
- A **Proof of Work (PoW)** based consensus algorithm
- Simulated **mining and block sealing**
- A **block reward** system
- **Merkle Tree** implementation for transaction integrity

##  Features

-  Custom blockchain built from scratch
-  Simulated Proof of Work for miner-based block validation
-  Modular and extensible architecture
-  Merkle Tree for secure transaction hashing
-  Block reward system for miners
